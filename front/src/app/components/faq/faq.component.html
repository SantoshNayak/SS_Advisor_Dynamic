                    Every Indian including an NRI is required to file an Income tax return where Total Income exceeds the basic exemption limit of Rs. 2,50,000 for an individual; Rs. 3,00,000 in case of a senior citizen (60 years or above) and Rs. 5,00,000 in case of a super senior citizen (80 years or above).
